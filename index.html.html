<h1>Optical Illusions!</h1>

<h2>Muller Lyer illusion</h2>
<h3>The Muller-Lyer illusion is a famous optical illusion from 1889 where two lines of equal length appear different because of added fins. A shaft with outward-pointing fins (< >) looks shorter, while one with inward-pointing fins (> <) appears longer. It is primarily caused by misinterpreted depth cues and "carpentered world" experiences.</h3>

<h2>Kanizsa Triangle</h2>
<h3>Kanizsa Triangle is an optical illusion where the brain perceives a bright white triangle that isn’t actually drawn. It happens because the mind fills in missing edges and shapes using visual cues from surrounding objects. This illusion shows how the brain actively constructs what we see, rather than simply recording reality.</h3>

<h2>Café wall illusion</h2>
<h3>The Café Wall Illusion is a geometric-optical illusion where parallel, straight lines between staggered, contrasting rows of bricks appear slanted or sloped. Discovered in the 1970s in Bristol, this phenomenon, also known as the Münsterberg or kindergarten illusion, depends on specific mortar, high contrast, and row alignment to create the visual distortion. </h3>

<h2>Ebbinghaus illusion</h2>
<h3>The Ebbinghaus illusion, also known as Titchener circles, is an optical illusion of relative size perception where a central circle appears smaller when surrounded by larger, rather than smaller, circles. Identical central circles are perceived differently based on surrounding context. It is used to study how the brain, rather than just the eye, processes visual information. </h3>

<h2>Herman grid</h2>
<h3>The Hermann grid illusion is a classic optical phenomenon featuring a black grid with white lines where "ghostlike" grey blobs appear at the intersections, except where you are directly looking. First reported in 1870, this effect is primarily attributed to lateral inhibition in the retina, where edge detection causes intersections to appear darker than lines. </h3>
